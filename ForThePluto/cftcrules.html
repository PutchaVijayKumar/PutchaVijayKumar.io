A reporting party shall report any publicly reportable swap transaction to a registered swap data repository as soon as technically possible/practicable. This is irrespective of whether the swap is executed bilaterally or on a swap execution platform.
<br/><br/>

All off-facility swaps shall be reported by the reporting party as soon as technologically practicable following execution as per the below rules.

<br/><br/><br/>

<b>Prohibition on disclosure of data</b><br/>
Registered swap execution facilities, designated contract markets, swap dealers and major swap participants shall not disclose swap transaction and pricing data related to publicly reportable swap transactions prior to the public dissemination of such data by a registered swap data repository unless:
<ol>
	<li>Such disclosure is made no earlier than the transmittal of data to a registered swap market data repository.</li>
	<li>Such disclosure is only made to market participants on such registered swap execution facility or designated contract markets.</li>
	<li>Market participants are provided advance notice of such disclosure; and</li>
	<li>Any such disclosure by the registered swap execution facility or designated contract market is non-discriminatory</li>
</ol>

<br/><br/>

<b>Availability of swap transactions and pricing data to the public</b>
<ul>
	<li>Registered swap data depositories shall publicly disseminate swap transactions and pricing data in a consistent, usable and machine-readable electronic format that allows the data to be downloaded, saved and analyzed.</li>
	<li>Data that is publicly disseminated shall be available from an Internet Website in a format that is freely available and readily accessible to the public</li>
	<li>Registered swap data repositories shall provide to the commission a hyperlink to the Internet Website where publicly disseminated swap transactions and pricing data can be accessed by the public.</li>
	<li>In general, any errors or ommissions in swap transactions and pricing data shall be corrected or cancelled as soon as possible.</li>
</ul>

<br/><br/>

<b>Timestamp Requirements</b><br/><br/>
<u>If the swap is executed on a SEF/DCA:</u><br/>
The SEF or DCA shall timestamp swap transactions and pricing data with the date and time to the nearest second as soon as:
<ul>
	<li>It receives the data from the swap counterparties</li>
	<li>Transmits such data to a registered swap data repository</li>
</ul>

<u>If the swap is executed bilaterally (off-facility swap) and reported to a SDR</u><br/>
The SD or MSP shall timestamp swap transaction and pricing data to the nearest second at the time of transmitting such data to the SDR.

<br/><br/>

<u>When the data is received by SDR</u><br/>
The SDR shall timestamp when:
<ul>
	<li>It receives data from a SEF, DCA or reporting party; and</li>
	<li>Publicly disseminates such data</li>
</ul>

<br/>

<b>Rules on what needs to be disclosed and not disclosed</b><br/>
<ol>
	<li>In general, only swap transactions and pricing information shall be reported to a SDR.</li>
	<li>The data shall not disclose the identities of the parties to the swap or otherwise facilitate the identification of parties to a swap</li>
	<li>The data should include the actual description of the underlying assets.</li>
	<li>The data should contain UPI.</li>
	<li>The notional and principal amounts should be rounded as follows:</li>
		<ol class="d">
			<li>If it is less than 1,000, it should be rounded to nearest five;</li>
			<li>If it is more than 1,000 but less than 10,000, it should be rounded to nearest 100</li>
			<li>If it is more than 10,000 but less than 100,000, it should be rounded to the nearest 1,000</li>
			<li>If it is more than 100,000 but less than 1 million, it should be rounded to nearest 10,000</li>

			<li>If it is more than 100 billion, it should be rounded to the nearest 50 billion</li>
		</ol>
	<br/>
	<li>There are rules on disclosure requirements based on the size of the notional or principal amounts of swaps. In essence, not all swap data need to be publicly disclosed by the SDR. Only some swaps whose notional or principal amounts vis-a-vis their tenor are within a certain range are required to be publicly disclosed. These rules are called as "Cap Size" rules. There are "Initial Cap Size" rules and "Post-Initial Cap Size" rules. The following are the swaps the information on which needs to be publicly disseminated as per the "Initial Cap Size" rules.
	<br/><br/>
	<u>For Interest Rate Swaps</u><br/>
		<ol>
			<li>For USD 250 million and above with a tenor greater than 0 and up to and including 2 years.</li>
			<li>From USD 100 million and up to USD 250 million with a tenor greater than 2 years and up to and including 10 years; and</li>
			<li>From USD 75 million and up to 100 million with a tenor greater than 10 years</li>
		</ol>
	<br/>

			<li>USD 250 million and above</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
<br/>

<li>CFTC shall establish post-initial cap size rules, from time to time, using reliable data collected by SDR, based on the following:</li>
	<ol>
		<li>A one year window of swap transactions and pricing data corresponding to each relevant swap category recalculated no less than one each calendar year; and</li>
		<li>The 75% notional amount calculation applied on Initial Cap Size rules, mentioned above</li>
	</ol>
<br/>

<li>Public dissemination of publicly reportable swap transactions may be subject to a time delay as per the following rules.</li>
	<ol>
		<li>Reporting should be no later than the prescribed time delay</li>
		<li>Reporting should be no sooner than the prescribed time delay</li>
