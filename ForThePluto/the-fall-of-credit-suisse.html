    <h2 class="main-heading-blue">The Fall of Credit Suisse</h2>
    <p style="text-align: center; font-style:italic; color: red">Date: 23rd March 2023</p>
    
    <br><br>
    Credit Suisse was a cornerstone of Swiss Finance Industry, one of the 30 systemically important banks in the world. After its collapse, it has been taken over by its competitor UBS Bank, supported by regulators. What triggered its collapse?
    <br><br>
    Before dwelving into facts, following is an excerpt from the press release of Swiss Financial Markets Supervisory Authority (FINMA).
    <br><br>

    <span class="flexbox-1">
    "The Credit Suisse Group is experiencing a crisis of confidence, which has manifested into considerable outflows of client funds. This was intensified by the upheaveals in the US banking market in March 2023. There was a risk on the bank becoming illiquid, even if it remained solvent, and it was necessary for the authorities to take action in order to prevent serious damage to the Swiss and international financial markets.
    <br><br>
    FINMA has been monitoring Credit Suisse intensively for several months. During this time, the bank has taken a number of measures to stabilize the situation. These were not enough to restore confidence in the bank, however, and more far-reaching options were also examined. To protect depositors and the financial markets, the offer by UBS to take over Credit Suisse has proven to be the most effective solution. FINMA has therefore approved this transaction."

    During 2008 Global Financial Crisis, it was one of the few banks that survived without a bailout and liquidity support. It had USD 1 trillion worth of assets, which sharply fell to USD 500 billion. While, the market was aware of its financial troubles for past two years, it did not anticipate such severe liquidity issues facing the bank resulting in its fall.
    <br><br>
    Credit Suisse suffered huge loss of USD 7.8 billion in 2022 and had been reeling under scandals, legal issues, management failures and loss of investor confidence over the years.
    <br><br><br>

    <h3 class="side-heading-blue">Loss from exposure to Archegos Capital Management</h3>

    In March 2021, Archegos Capital Management, an investment management company, lost many of its bets and could not meet margin calls. It was Credit Suisse's important customer. Credit Suisse lost about USD 5.5 billion from the collapse of Archegos, which proved too big to handle.
    <br><br><br>

    <h3 class="side-heading-blue">Valuation of Assets and Balance Sheet Issues</h3>

    Following are some key numbers from Credit Suisse's annual report.
    <br><br>
    Assets = USD 574 billion (as per valuation)
    <br>
    Liabilities = USD 525 billion (this is fixed and real)
    <br>
    Capital = USD 48 billion
    <br>
    Market value of company = USD 9.7 billion
    <br><br>
    The above numbers imply the following.
    <br><br>
    <ul>
        <li>The capital as a percent of assets is about 8.5%</li>
        <li>The capital adequacy ratio should be less than 8.5% after applying the risk weights to the assets</li>
    </ul>

    <br>
    
    The above two are not good numbers but they are not bad either. The trouble starts when we take into account market expectations.
    <br><br>

    <ul>
        <li>The stock was worth 20% its book value (USD 9.7 billion market value upon USD 48 billion book value)</li>
        <li>If the market value is USD 9.7 billion and liabilities are USD 525 billion, then the value of the assets, as per market, should be USD 534.7 billion</li>
        <li>However, the value as per books is USD 574 billion</li>
        <li>Thus, the market thinks that asset valuation is off by about USD 39 billion, which is about 6.8%</li>
        <li>The ratio of capital as a percent of assets, as per market, is now 1.8%, which means the company is significantly undercapitalized, at least as per market.</li>

    </ul>
    <br>

    In a scenario of high interest rate and global banking crisis, raising capital is not easy. Credit Suisse had to raise capital and increase liquidity. The Swiss central bank provided liquidity, but it could not help in raising capital. As per Reuters, Credit Suisse had approached Deutsche Bank and other major global banks for capital, but the timelines were too tight to strike a good deal. Eventually, the regulators intervened and asked UBS to take over it.
    <br><br><br>

    <h3 class="side-heading-blue">The Deal</h3>
    UBS acquired Credit Suisse. The following are the details of the government brokered deal.
    <br><br>
    
    <ul>
        <li>UBS to pay about USD 3.2 billion in stocks (it's an all stocks deal, no cash involved)</li>
        <li>The Swiss National Bank (SNB), the central bank of Switzerland, provides a USD 108 billion liquidity line</li>
        <li>The Swiss government grants a USD 9.8 billion of guarantee for potential losses on some Credit Suisse assets</li>
        <li>As per regulator FINMA about USD 17 billion Credit Suisse bonds will become worthless.</li>
        <li>UBS will shrink Credit Suisse's investment banking arm</li>
    </ul>

    <br>

    <span class="flexbox-1">
    Note: UBS offered USD 1.08 billion in an all-stock deal when the market cap of Credit Suisse was USD 9.7 billion. At the time of deal closure, market value had fallen close to USD 3.2 billion, which matched the renewed offer of UBS.
