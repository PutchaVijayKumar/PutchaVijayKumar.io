<br>

Trade reporting is different from transaction reporting in many ways. To start with, the purpose of trade reporting is to increase post-trade transparency for the purpose of enforcing Best Execution rules, while the purpose of transaction reporting is to prevent market abuse and reduce systemic risk. While transaction reporting is present in most countries, trade reporting is, currently, applicable in European Economic Area (EEA) under MiFID rules. 
<br><br>

The following table shows the differences between these two reporting requirements under MiFID.
