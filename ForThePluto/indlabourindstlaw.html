<br/><br/>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
The industrial revolution in the world during the 19th century brought about radical changes in the western world. The significant changes in the method of production, shipping and transportation resulted in corresponding changes in the social set-up. These scientific and technological developments in the industrial sector culminated in the emergence of two classes namely, the working class (wage earning class) and the managerial class (entrepreneur class). These two classes strive always for conflicting interest. The working class demand higher wages and better working conditions, while the managerial class demand higher productivity and minimum wages. 
<br/><br/>

Slowly but steadily, the working class formed unions and conducted movements to put forward their case, and this resulted in the passage of various laws in the protection of the working class. These various laws put together are collectively known as the Labour and Industrial Laws. Of these various laws, the following are some of the essential laws.
<br/><br/>

<ol>
	<li>Trade Union Act, 1929</li>
	<li>The Industrial Disputes Act, 1947</li>
	<li>The Factories Act, 1948</li>
	<li>The Minimum Wages Act, 1948</li>
	<li>The Payment of Wages Act, 1936</li>
	<li>The Industrial Employment (Standing Orders) Act. 1946</li>
	<li>The Workmen’s Compensation Act, 1923</li>
	<li>The Employees State Insurance Act, 1948</li>
	<li>Payment of Bonus Act, 1965</li>
	<li>The Maternity Benefit Act, 1961</li>
</ol>

These above acts are discussed below.
<br/><br/><br/>


<h3 align="center">TRADE UNION ACT, 1926</h3>
<br/>

<u>Trade Union: Meaning and Definition</u><br/>
The word Trade Union is commonly understood as “an association of wage earners or workers”. It is essentially an organisation or association of workers for the purposes of forwarding and defending their professional interest.
<br/><br/>

However, the Trade Union Act defines it as follows. <br/>
“any combination whether temporary or permanent, formed primarily: <br/>
<ol class="d">
	<li>for the purpose of regulating relations between:</li>
		<ol class="e">
			<li>workmen and employers; or</li>
			<li>workmen and workmen; or</li>
			<li>employers and employers</li>
	</ol>
	<br/>
	<li>imposing respective conditions on the conduct of any trade or business and includes any federation of two or more trade unions, is called Trade Union</li>
</ol>
<br/>

The Act shall not apply to:<br/>
<ol>
	<li>Any agreement between partners as to their own business</li>
	<li>Any agreement between an employer and those employed by him as to such employment; or</li>
	<li>Any agreement in consideration of the sales of the goodwill of a business or of instruction in any profession, trade or handicraft.</li>
</ol>
<br/>
<b><u>Essential Elements of a Trade Union</u></b><br/>
To constitute a trade union:
<ol>
	<li>There must be combination of workmen or employers</li>
	<li>There must be trade or business; and</li>
	<li>The main object of the Union must be to regulate relations of employers and employees or to impose restrictive conditions on the conduct of any trade or business.</li>
</ol>
<br/>

<b><u>Recognition of Trade Unions:</u></b><br/>
A trade union can be recognised by the employer and the central government. A Union which is statutorily recognised must be entitled to the following additional priviledges and rights compared to an unregistered union.

<ol>
	<li>the right to sole representation of the workers in any collective bargaining</li>
	<li>to raise issues and enter into agreements with employers on general questions concerning the terms and conditions of employment</li>
	<li>to collect membership fees and subscription payable by members to the union within the premises of the undertakings or demand check off facility.</li>
	<li>to put notice board in the premises of the undertaking and affix notices relating to meetings, statements of accounts and other announcements</li>
	<li>to discuss with employer the grievances of the workers</li>
	<li>to nominate its representatives to the grievance committee or statutory and non-statutory bipartitate committees.</li>
</ol>

The recognition of a trade union is different from its registration. A trade union registered under the Act is entitled to all the protections and rights contemplated by the Act even if it is not recognised by the employer.

<br/><br/><br/>

<b><u>Registration of a Trade Union</u></b><br/>
A registered trade union is entitled to get some benefits and protection under the act. The members of a registered trade union are entitled to get protection, immunity, exemption from certain civil and criminal liabilities. It must be noted that individual disputes become industrial dispute only when it is represented by a registered or unregistered trade union.
<br/><br/>
The registration of a trade union is not compulsory under the act, but is desirable. A trade union, if decides to register itself, should be registered under the Trade Union Act only. It must not be registered under any other acts or provisions. However, a Civil Servants’ Union cannot
be registered under the Trade Unions Act, as government servants cannot form trade unions.
<br/><br/>
Every State has a Registrar of Trade Unions who is in charge of registering the trade unions. The minimum number of members of a trade union for registration purposes should be 10, if the aggregate members of workmen who are memebrs of such trade union is 100. In all other cases, the minimum number of members for registration purposes is 7.
<br/><br/>

Application for registration of a Trade Union should be made in Form A, together with the following details. <br/>
<ol>
	<li>names, occupations and address of the members making the application</li>
	<li>the place of work of the members making the application</li>
	<li>the name of the Trade Union, its address and its head office</li>
	<li>titles, names, age, address and occupations of the office bearers of the trade unions.</li>
</ol>
<br/>
The rules or bye-laws of the trade union should provide for the following.<br/>
<ol>
	<li>Name of the trade union</li>
	<li>Objects of its establishment</li>
	<li>The purposes for which the general funds would be spent</li>
	<li>Maintenance of records such as Member List, Office Bearers, etc.</li>
	<li>The procedure for admission of ordinary members, honorary and temporary members</li>
	<li>The minimum subscription amount (which shall not be less than Rs. 1 per year for rural workers and Rs. 3 per year for other unorganised sectors and Rs. 12 per year for workers in any other cases.</li>
	<li>The condition under which any member would be entitled to any benefit under the rules</li>
	<li>The rules for conduct and imposition of fine</li>
	<li>The procedure for amendment of rules</li>
	<li>The rules and procedure regarding safe custody of funds, annual audit of accounts and facilities for office-bearers and inspection of books</li>
	<li>The rules and regulations regarding dissolution of trade union (Under the rules at least 1/2 of the office bearers must be persons actually engaged or employed in the plant or industry that the Union represents)</li>
</ol>
<br/>
The registrar after being satisfied with the application may grant a certificate of registration to the union.
<br/><br/>
A certificate of registration is a conclusive evidence that the trade union is duly registered under the act. The trade union once registered becomes a separate legal entity, which shall have perpetual succession and its own common seal. It can sue and be sued by others. It can also acquire movable and immovable property on its own.
<br/><br/>

<b><u>Cancellation or withdrawl of Registration</u></b><br/>
The certificate of registration of a trade union can be cancelled in the following cases.<br/>
If the certificate has been obtained by the trade union</li>
<ol class="e">
	<li>by means of fraud, or</li>
	<li>by mistake, or</li>
	<li>if the trade union is not in existence, or</li>
	<li>if the trade has contravened any provisions of the act willfully, or</li>
	<li>if the trade union has incorporated any rule in its Rules, which is inconsistent with the provisions of the act or any rules made thereunder, to continue in force.</li>
	<li>if any person is aggrieved by the order of the Registrar then he may file an appeal before the High Court within 60 days of hte order of cancellation.</li>
</ol>
<br/>

<b><u>Recognition of Central Trade Unions</u></b><br/>
The central government recognises some trade unions as Central Trade Unions for the purposes of representation in the world organisations and international conferences, if they fulfull the following conditions.
<ol>
	<li>The union has a minimum of 5 lakh members</li>
	<li>The union must have members from at least 4 states</li>
	<li>The union must have membership from at least 4 industries</li>
</ol>
The Central Chief Labour Commissioner will make verification relating to the fulfillment of the above mentioned conditions.
<br/><br/><br/>

<b><u>Privileges and Immunities of a registered trade union</u></b><br/>
The Trade Unions Act provides certain privileges and immunities to the members/leaders of the registered trade unions so as to enable them to carry out their legitimate trade union activities without any fear or threat of civil or criminal actions or liabilities. The immunity from civil or criminal liability constitutes the most important basic right without which the office bearers of the registered trade unions may not be able to discharge their duties properly, efficiently and successfully.<br/>
<br/>

The following are some of the immunities or privileges of the registered trade unions.<br/>
<ol>
	<li>Civil Liability</li>
		<ol class="d">
			<li>Immunity from civil liability</li>
			<li>Immunity from tortious liability</li>
			<li>Immunity from agreements in restraint of trade</li>
		</ol>
	<li>Criminal Liability</li>
</ol>

<br/>
<u>1. Civil Liability:</u><br/>
The trade union act provides immunity from civil suits in certain cases to the leaders and office bearers of the registered trade unions.
<br/><br/>

<span class="normalind25">
<u>(a) Immunity from civil liability</u><br/>
If the leaders or office bearers, while conducting thier duties, induce some other persons to break a contract of employment, or is in interference with the trade, business or employment of some other then the leaders or office bearers cannot be held responsible through a civil suit.

If the Union or its members have performed some tortuous acts for furtherance of a trade dispute, then no suit can be brought about on them in any civil courts in respect of such tortuous acts.

If the act done is not for furtherance of the trade dispute then the immunity is not applicable. Similarly, if the inducement or acts done by the trade unions or its members are by illegal means such as violence, intimidation, etc., then the immunity is not applicable.
</span>

<br/>

<span class="normalind25">
<u>(b) Immunity from tortious liability:</u><br/>
A registered trade union is not liable for torts committed by its agents in furtherance of trade disputes, if such agents acted:
	<ol class="e">
		<li>without the knowledge of the executive committee of the Trade Union; or</li>
		<li>contrary to the express instructions of the executive committee.</li>
	</ol>

</span>

<br/>
<span class="normalind25">
<u>(c) Immunity from agreements in restraint of trade</u><br/>
As per the Indian Contract Act, any agreement which restraints the pursuance of a lawful profession, trade or business is against public policy and hence is void. However, reasonable restrictions may be imposed upon the freedom of trade in some cases such as to avoid monopoly, or to control prices, etc. In such cases, any agreement between the members of the registered trade union is valid and binding on the members, though it is in restraint of trade.
</span>

<br/><br/>

<u>2. Criminal Liability:</u><br/>
The Union and its members are immune from criminal liability of criminal conspiracy.
<br/><br/>
Criminal Conspiracy refers to “agreements between two or more persons to do an illegal act or a legal act but by illegal means”.
<br/><br/>
Under the existing criminal laws an agreement to do an illegal act is itself a criminal offense. For example, two men who agree to persuade workmen to break their contracts with their employers are guilty of criminal conspiracy. The Trade Union Act protects trade unionists from ciminal conspiracy, as long as the agreement is in furtherance of their profession.
<br/><br/><br/>

<b><u>Minor as a member of Trade Union</u></b><br/>
A registered trade union can admit a minor, who has attained the age of 15 years, as a member. The minor so appointed shall enjoy the same benefits as that of a member who is a major. However, he is not allowed to become an office bearer of the union until he attains the age of 18.
<br/><br/><br/>


<b><u>Collective Bargaining</u></b><br/>
Collective bargaining or negotiations is one of the methods for settlement of an industrial dispute. Through this method, the workers and management can bilaterally discuss and settle an industrial dispute without the involvement of a third party. This method is preferable as it provides an amicable solutions to the dispute.
<br/><br/>
In India, collective bargaining agreements are enforceable under the Industrial Dispute Act, 1947 by filing a petition in Labour Court or Industrial Tribunal.
<br/><br/>
The advantages of collective bargaining is that it imposes obligation on both the parties to the dispute and creates a code of conduct. It also prevents strikes and unrest in the industry. The only major disadvantage in this type of settlement is that hike in wages and other amenities to workmen results in higher cost of production.
<br/><br/><br/>

<b><u>General Fund and Political Fund</u></b><br/>
A trade union is entitled to maintain two kinds of funds, namely
<ol>
	<li>General Fund</li>
	<li>Political Fund</li>
</ol>

The trade unions should spend the funds for the purposes specified in the act.
<br/><br/>

	<li>Legal expenses related to prosecution or defence for protecting any rights of the trade union</li>
	<li>For conducting trade disputes on behalf of the union or any member</li>
</ol>
<br/>

The contribution for the political fund must be collected separately. The contribution to the political fund cannot be mandatory or put as a pre-condition for membership into the trade union. The fund may be managed or controlled only by those who have contributed to the fund.
<br/>

Industry does not include spiritual or religious services and activities of charitable nature (non-profit activities).
<br/><br/>
Hence, the answer to the question above is that hospital, educational institutions, statutory bodies and solicitor’s office are all defined as ‘industry’ under the act, as they are involve systematic activity, cooperation between employer and employee and production and distribution of goods and services for satisfaction of human wants.
<br/><br/><br/>


<b><u>Industrial Dispute and Individual Dispute</u></b><br/>
As per the act, industrial dispute refers to any dispute or differences between (i) employers and employees, or (ii) employers and workmen, or (iii) workmen and workmen, which is connected with the employment or non-employment or the terms of employment or with the conditions of
labour of any person.
<br/><br/>
An industrial dispute is one where a particular dispute is supported or taken-up by a registered or recognized trade union or body of workers.
<br/><br/>
An individual dispute is one where the dispute is between an individual employee or workmen and the employer or between two workmen in an industry, but without the support of such dispute by any trade unions or a majority group of workers.
<br/><br/>
Even if a trade union supports an individual dispute, at least half of the members of the industry should be members of that trade unions, without which the union will not be legally competent to represent the dispute. Such disputes can be settled through ordinary civil courts but not through Industrial Tribunals.
<br/><br/><br/>

<b><u>Strikes and Lockouts:</u></b><br/>
They are the most effective weapons of the workmen and the employer respectively to meet their demands and to safeguard their interests.
<br/><br/>

<b><u>Strike:</u></b><br/>
It is an act by which employees stop working until their demands are met by the employer. The stoppage of work is meant to bring pressure on the employer to concede to their demands. It is a weapon in the armoury of the working class to fight collectively against the employer.
<br/><br/>

<u>Essentials of Strike:</u><br/>
<ol>
	<li>Cessation of work</li>
	<li>Cessation of work by a body of persons employed in any industry</li>
	<li>Acting in combination</li>

</ol>

<u>Classification of Strikes:</u><br/>
<ol>
	<li>Alternate day strike</li>

	<li>Pendown strike</li>
	<li>Tool-down strike</li>
	<li>Folded-arms strike</li>
	<li>Gherao, etc.</li>
</ol>
Strikes can also be classified into (i) Strikes in Public Utility Services; and (ii) Strikes in Non-Public Utility Services.
<br/><br/>
When any industrial dispute arises in a public utility service, a notice need to be served as per applicable rules.
<br/><br/>

<b><u>Lock-Out</u></b><br/>
It literally means “to shut or to close”. It refers to closure of an industrial establishment for a particular period to suppress the prevailing situation in the industry. Lock-Out is an antithesis of Strike. It is an act of the employer, by which his industrial establishment is temporarily closed to suppress the demands of his employees and to make them resume duties at his own terms and conditions.

	<li>The act of the employer is motivated by coercion</li>
</ol>

<u>Lock-Out and Closure</u><br/>
Lock-Out is an voluntary act of the employer to force his employees to accept his terms and conditions of employment. The lock-out is usually done against a strike by the employees. It is mainly done to suppress the demands of the employees. A closure, on the other hand, is not voluntary.
It is done primarily due to financial or other difficulties faced by the business establishment or industry.
<br/><br/>

<u>Lock-Out and Lay-Off</u><br/>
Lock-Out is done to suppress the demands of the employees. Lay-off is for trade reasons, which are beyond the control of the employer. Lock-Out is due to an industrial dispute. Lay-Off is not concerned with industrial dispute. It happens due to unfavorable financial or operational circumstances.

<b><u>Theory of Notional Extension:</u></b><br/>
Generally, the work of a workman commences when he reaches the place of work, and comes to an end when he leaves the place of work, after completing his work. The period of going to place of work and returning home from place, is generally excluded for the purpose of computing
course of employment. However, there are certain circumstances in which this period is included in computing the course of employment. In such cases, if the accident occurs during the period the workman reaches the place of work or after he leaves the place of work, it is treated as course
of employment period and the employer is liable to pay compensation for such accidents. 
<br/><br/>
One example of such inclusive period or extension is when the employer provides transport facilities to the workman.
<br/><br/>
There are no proper rules and regulations for this extension. The courts takes into account the situation and give award based on the unique circumstances of a case.
