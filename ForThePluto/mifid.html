<h3 div id="top" align="center">MIFID</h3>

The Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID) is a framework of rules of European Union for investment intermediaries providing services to clients in relation to shares, bonds, units in collective investment schemes (UCITS) and derivatives, which are collectively known as Financial Instruments, and the organised trading of such financial instruments.
<br/><br/>
The object of the framework is to provide a harmonised regulatory environment for investment services across the 31 states of the European Economic Area (the 28-member states of the EU, together with Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein), which is commonly referred to as EEA. It also aims to increase competition and consumer protection by providing a single and consistent rulebook across the EEA and a level playing field between the EEA's trading venues for financial instruments.
<br/><br/>
Prior to MiFID, the Investment Services Directive (ISD) tried to achieve the same objectives but had to be upgraded to MiFID keeping in view the changes in the investment services industry.
<br/><br/>
MiFID is the cornerstone of the European Commission's Financial Services Action Plan (FSAP). It has brought about significant changes in the regulatory environment together with other directives of the EU such as the Prospective Directive, Market Abuse Directive and Transparency Directive.
<br/><br/><br/>

<b><u>What type of organisations are covered by MiFID?</u></b><br/>
The following organisations are covered by MiFID.
<ol>
	<li>Investment banks</li>
	<li>Portfolio managers</li>
	<li>Stock brokers and broker dealers</li>
	<li>Corporate finance firms</li>
	<li>Many futures and options firms</li>
	<li>Private wealth management firms</li>
	<li>Some commodity firms; and</li>
	<li>Markets, particularly Regulated Markets (RM) and Multilateral Trading Facilities (MTF)</li>
</ol>

In order to determine which firms are affected by MiFID and which are not, MiFID distinguishes firms into two categoris - investment services and activities ("core" services) and ancilliary services ("non-core" services). Examples of core services include investment advice, receipt and transmission of orders in relation to financial instruments, portfolio management services, dealing on own account, execution of orders on behalf of cleints, and operation of RM and MTFs. Examples of ancilliary services include safeguarding and administration of financial instruments, investment research and financial analysis, and underwriting services. If a firm performs both core and ancilliary services then it is subjected to MiFID. If it provides only ancilliary services then it is not subjected to MiFID.
<br/><br/><br/>

<b><u>What type of products are covered by MiFID?</u></b><br/>
Transactions in the following products are covered under MiFID.
<ol>
	<li>Transferable securities</li>
	<li>Money market instruments</li>
	<li>Units in collective investment undertakings</li>
	<li>Options, futures, swaps, forward rate agreements and other derivative contracts relating to securities, currencies, interest rates or yields, or other derivative instruments, financial indices or financial measures which may be settled physically or in cash.</li>
	<li>Options, futures, swaps, forward rate agreements and other derivative contracts relating to commodities that must be settled in cash or may be settled in cash at the option of one of the parties, other than by reason of default or other termination event. </li>
	<li>Options, futures, swaps and other derivative contracts relating to commodities that can be physically settled provided that they are traded on a regulated markets and/or on an MTF.</li>
	<li>Options, futures, swaps and other derivative contracts relating to commodities that can be physically settled through recognised clearing houses or are subject to regular margin calls.</li>
	<li>Derivative instruments for the transfer of credit risk</li>
	<li>Financial contracts for differences</li>

It also includes the above-mentioned contracts if they are settled thrugh recognised clearing houses.</li>
	
</ol>
<br/>

<b><u>Investor Protection</u></b><br/>
The investor protection guidelines of MiFID are based on the concept that the highest level of protection should be given to those clients with the least knowledge and experience and, conversely, the lowest level of protection should be given to the most knowledgeable and experienced clients. Accordingly, the clients were categorised into the following three categories:
<ol>
	<li>Retail</li>
	<li>Professional</li>
	<li>Eligible counterparties</li>
</ol>
