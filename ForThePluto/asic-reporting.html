<h2 div id="top" align="center">Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) Reporting</h2>
<br/>


ASIC Reporting refers to the mandatory derivatives transactions reporting regime implemented by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission for monitoring and prevention of systemic risk. The rule came into force in 2013.
<br><br>

<h3 class="c">Who is affected by this regulation?</h3>
If any any counterparty to the trade has a reporting obligation they must report that trade even if their counterparty also reports the trade. That means, there exist dual reporting obligations similar to EMIR. However, certain exemptions are also provided for dual reporting. The following are some of them.
<br><br>
<b><u>Exceptions to reporting oblgations</u></b><br>
If an entity's gross notional outstanding positions across all OTC derivatives for two consecutive quarters is less than AUD $5 billion then it is need not report the transactions, but at least one counterparty has to report.
<br><br>

<h3 class="c">Which firms are required to report?</h3>
The following firms are required to report.
<ol>
	<li>Australian firms (incorporated or formed in Australia).</li>
	<li>Foreign subsidiaries of Australian authorised deposit taking institutions or Australian Financial Services Licensees, as per the Corporation Act, 2001.</li>
	<li>Foreign authorised deposit taking institutions with Australian branches (only trades booked in Australia)</li>
	<li>Foreign companies offering debentures or guaranteering debentures in Autralia (only trades booked in Autralia)</li>
</ol>

<br>

<h3 class="c">Which trades need to be reported?</h3>
OTC Derivatives trades in the following asset clases need to be reported.
<ol>
	<li>Credit</li>
	<li>Commodities (excluding electricity)</li>
	<li>Equities</li>
	<li>FX</li>
	<li>Rates</li>
</ol>

<ul>
	<li>Australian firms and their subsidiaries must report all derivatives trades meeting the above criteria.</li>
	<li>Non-Australian firms must report all derivatives meeting the above criteria which are entered into in Australia or booked in Australia</li>
</ul>
<br>

<h3><font style="font-family: consolas">What should be reported?</font></h3>

<ul>
	<li>New trades</li>
	<li>Modifications (including changes in valuation)</li>
	<li>Terminations</li>
	<li>Assignments</li>
	<li>Step-in/out transactions</li>
	<li>Others</li>
</ul>

<font color="red" style="font-family: consolas">	Exchange traded derivative transactions are not reportable.</font>

<br><br>
Essentially the requirements for an Australian Financial Services License (AFSL) derivatives issuer/broker are to carry out the following on a daily basis.
<ul>
	<li>Report all trades</li>
	<li>Report end of day open positions; and</li>
	<li>Submit and modifications</li>
</ul>

Thus, essentially, trades and end-of-day open positions have to be reported.

<br><br>

<h3 class="c">When should they reported?</h3>
T+1

<br><br>

<h3 class="c">How can firms meet their reporting obligations?</h3>
<b><u>Non-Australian Firms</u></b><br>
Non-Australian firms may take advantage of the fact that ASIC has recognised EMIR as an equivalent reporting regime. This means that instead of reporting to a licensed ASIC trade repository, firms may instead report to an EMIR trade repository recognized by ASIC as a 'prescribed trade repository'.

<br><br>

<b><u>Australian Firms</u></b><br>
Austalian firms can report to ASIC registered trade repositories. These are called as Australian Derivatives Trade Repository (ASIC).

<br><br>

<h3 class="c">What data is reported?</h3>
The requirements are divided into two categories.
<ul>
	<li>Common data; and</li>
	<li>Data specific to each asset class</li>
</ul>

Broadly, the following details are to be reported.

<ul>
	<li>The economic terms of the transaction</li>
	<li>The product, transaction and entity identifers</li>
	<li>Information on whether the transaction is centrally cleared</li>
	<li>Valuation (mark-to-market, mark-to-model or other valuation) and collateral;</li>
	<li>Legal Entity Identifier</li>
</ul>
<br>
