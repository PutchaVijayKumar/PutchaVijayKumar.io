    <h2 class="main-heading-blue">Cryptocurrencies - A Question of Trust</h2>
    <div class="fordate">By Putcha Vijay Kumar, Date: 2nd November 2022</div>

    <br><br>

    I am not sure what to write on Cryptocurrencies. There is so much literature on this topic that it feels a bit useless contributing more to the already abundant knowledge. Nonetheless, many have requested information on this topic and hence I am sharing my thoughts about it through this article. It is a long article but I hope it would be useful. 
    <br><br>

    <h3 class="side-heading-blue">Game of Database Entries</h3>
    <br>
    If I say I have $100 in a bank (say Bank of America), in one way, I am saying that Bank of America has got a database in which against my name there is a credit of $100. If I want to transfer $50 to my friend Kiran, who has also got an account in Bank of America, this means, Bank of America is reducing $50 against my name in its database and increasing $50 against Kiran's name in its database. Similarly, if I am sending $20 to my friend Arvind, who holds a bank account with Citibank, ignoring the transaction methodology, we can say that $20 is reduced from my name in the database of Bank of America and the same is increased against Arvind's name in the database maintained by Citibank. If there is nothing against my name in the database of Bank of America, it means I do not have any money. I might have a few in hard currency notes and cash, but we will discuss this later.
    <br><br>
    Let's look at stocks. If I hold 100 shares of Intel, it means that there is a Central Security Depository (CSD) that is maintaining a database in which against my name there are 100 shares of Intel. If I transfer 50 shares to my friend, the CSD will change the records in its database by reducing against my name and increasing against my friend's name in its database. If my name does not appear in its record, it means that I do not own any shares.
    <br><br>
    Now, let's look at property. If I have a physical house, it also means that there is a registry maintained by the government in which my name appears as title holder of the house. If my name does not appear in this registry, then I may not have title to the property. I may be physically living in the house but if the information is missing in the database maintained by the government then it means that I have no legal rights on the property.
    <br><br>
    Let's look at messages. If I want to send an email, or post twitter message, or Facebook post, it means that there is a company which is maintaining a database in which my name appears and against my name some records (email and posts) appear.
    <br><br>
    We are living in a world where most of the information is stored digitally in databases and we trust the <mark>database keepers</mark>. In the above examples, we trust the bank to maintain the database well so that we know we have money, the central security depository to maintain a database so that we know we have stocks, companies such as Google, Twitter and Facebook to maintain their databases so that we can send messages, posts and pictures, and a government registry to maintain the property register properly so that we can have ownership of our property.
    <br><br>
    <span class="flexbox-1">
        Just imagine if we merge all these different databases into one large database, which is run by just one or few companies. Whoever runs that database would be the most powerful person on Earth. They will control our lives and the way the world works.
    </span>
    <br><br>
    So, essentially we are trusting someone for something all the time. Through a system of laws, the trust is enforced, and the world works the way we know it now.
    <br><br>
    Sometimes this trust may not work as we expect and companies may take advantage of its position and trust. A recent example of this is of Google's Play Store services. Google's mobile operating software "Android" has the highest market share in India, just like it does in other countries. If a developer develops an app and wishes to make it available to mobile users using Android phones, then it must publish it in Google's Play Store and accept Google's terms and conditions. Most app developers would like to sell in-app digital goods as it is a source of income for them, which monetizes their creation and innovations. However, for in-app digital goods to be distributed to users, developers must first configure their apps so that all purchases of the digital goods go through Google's payment system, which processes the transaction. Google's Play Store policies require the app developers to exclusively and mandatorily use Google Play's Billing System (GPBS). not only for receiving payments for apps but also for in-app purchases. Further, app developers cannot, within an app, provide users with direct links to the webpage containing an alternative payment method or use language that encourages a user to purchase the digital item outside of the app (anti-steering provisions). If the app developer do not comply with the GBPS, they are not allowed to list their apps in the play store. In short, Google was taking advantage of the app database that it maintains to make money for itself. The Competitive Commission of India (CCI) found these conditions anti-competitive and levied a fine of Rs. 936.44 crores and asked Google to change its policies.
    <br><br>
    So, the system of trust does not work automatically, it needs to be reinforced through a system of laws and enforcement mechanisms.
    <br><br>
    Anyway, whatever be the mechanism, the system works, and we are living in the system.
    <br><br>
    But the question is: <b>Why do we always need to trust someone?</b>. Can't we have a system where we do not have to trust anyone but the system itself. That is exactly the question asked by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008 when he published a famous white paper titled "A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System", which ended up inventing Bitcoin, the most popular cryptocurrency. We do not know whether Satoshi Nakamoto is a real person, but we will use that name as it is the name of the author in that white paper.
    <br><br>
    His argument is that we can have a peer-to-peer electronic database which is based on cryptographic proof instead of trust. One way to put it is: let's say I want to buy a cup of coffee for $10, for this I need to transfer $10 to the coffee vendor. The actual transfer is made by my bank which makes changes in its database. This means I and the coffee vendor are relying on a bank for this transaction to happen. This trust that we have on bank to complete the transaction is not free of cost, the bank might charge a few cents or dollars for enabling this transaction or making changes to its database. <b>This is the cost of trust.</b>
    <br><br>
    
    Can we remove the bank from the transaction and make the transfer directly? The peer-to-peer electronic cash system is designed to do that. It removes the bank (third party or intermediary) from the equation. But that does not mean that this system does not depend on a third party. Instead, it replaces a single party (i.e. the bank) with a lot of unrelated parties.
    <br><br>
    
    The idea is that instead of allowing a single party (in this example, the bank) which is maintaining the database, why not create multiple databases that are linked to each other and maintained by multiple people so that we do not have to trust a single party or a few parties. In this way, we are trusting a network of databases or a system.
    <br><br>

    We will call the databases as ledger, henceforth, to talk the language of cryptocurrencies. And, since the ledger (database) is maintained by many people we will call it as <mark>distributed ledger</mark>.
    <br><br>

    Santoshi's argument was that we can have many people maintaining these ledgers and the consensus of these ledgers provides the proof of something. For example, the consensus of these ledgers (distributed ledgers) could be a proof that we own money or owe money, could mean that we own a piece of land, or it could be a proof of ownership and title rights to a music album, ownership of a piece of art, ownership of a vehicle, driving license, and other such things in life.
    <br><br>

    Santoshi himself did not hint about all the possible uses of the distributed ledger. He was more focussed on its use as a peer-to-peer cash transfer system and that's why he titled his article as such. But the concept of having the distributed ledger can be extended not just to cash but many other things in our day-to-day life.
    <br><br>

    In this article, we will focus on the cash part, as that's the topic we are discussing.
    <br><br>

    In case of a distributed ledger dealing with peer-to-peer electronic cash, we need to identify or give some name to that cash. It cannot be called dollars, pounds, rupees, etc., as those are names of money given by the central banks of the countries. The governments together with the central banks have invented those currencies, maintain it and, hence, they have a sort of copyright on it. We need to have our own name for our cash. Let's call it X-Coin.
    <br><br>
    
    The distributed ledgers running our X-Coin is fine conceptually but there are a few things that need to be addressed. First, why would anyone want to maintain a ledger for someone else? I would not like to waste my time recording things that others have done. What benefit that this accrue to me? To address this issue, let's reward those ledger keepres with some money. But insead of giving money created by someone else, why not give the money that we crated - our own X-Coin. So, we say that anyone who maintains these ledgers will get a few X-coins.
    <br><br>

    But then we run into another problem now. We discussed about consensus of ledgers. If everyone maintains their own ledgers, and the balance of cash recorded in one ledger does not match the balanace in another ledger then we do not know what the right amount of money that someone owns. Therefore, the concept of consensus is important. Ledgers need to match. Everyone maintaining these distributed ledgers need to be honest and maintain the ledgers properly, so that we can have consensus. So, the way it works is that when a transaction is done, it is published to the entire network (of ledger keepers), and the ledger keepers will have to verify it and make changes to their own ledgers. We will get into the technicalities of how this verification is done later but for now just assume that there is a prescribed method in which the ledger keepers verify the transactionss. Once most of them verify the transaction, a consenus is achieved and changes are made to all ledgers. 
    <br><br>

    Another problem is that there should be an order of transaction. If I have a X-Coin and I sent it to you, and then I send it to someone else, who actually has the X-Coin? Since the ledgers are maintained by different people, there is no guarantee that the information about this transaction has reached all of them at the same time. If one ledger keeper records the transactions but the other does not then there is no consensus and in between all this I can use the same X-Coin for multiple transactions, which is called "double spending". To solve this issue, the ledger keepers must agree on a single history of the order in which they are received, and this is called the "<b>blockchain</b>". In simple terms, it is a chain of transactions that are recorded by all ledger keepers in the same way.
    <br><br>
    
    Another problem is that a large bad group of people may come forward to run these ledgers and deliberately make wrong entries. If that large group of bad people is more than the good group of people running these ledgers, then the consensus will shift towards the bad group and they can steal our X-Coins or put the system into chaos. To prevent this, the people who run these ledgers are made to work harder by way of solving complex puzzles (which we will call as <b>mining</b>). The mining involves doing some work (we will discuss the technicalities later) for the purpose of verification of transactions and in the process, they also generate the X-Coins for themselves. Thus, mining is done for two things - to verify transactions broadcasted to the distributed ledger and to make X-Coins for themsleves. In a way, the miners generate X-Coins to pay for themselves whenever they successfully verify transactions and record them in their ledgers. When many miners do the same job, everyone cannot get the X-Coins, only the one who solves the puzzle first and verifies the transactions gets the X-Coins. But there are so many transactions that are broadcasted to the network so that every miner has a chance to mine something and earn our X-Coins.
    <br><br>

    But still, it is possible, that the large group of people can do a lot of mining and thereby create the consensus and take a lot of X-Coins for themselves and spoil the network. However, there is a catch! If such bad group has spent so much effort in mining and earned our X-Coins, they would be foolish to spoil the network now because if the network is broken, the value of the X-Coins will become nothing, and they would lose too. Therefore, there is a self-imposed discipline in the network. Those who mine get X-Coins, not dollars or other currencies. Therefore, they are forced in a way to be honest to preserve the value of X-Coins.
    <br><br>

    Through this system of blockchain, we created X-Coins and maintain a public ledger of money. We are not relying on an individual but a network of ledger keepers, who maintain the ledgers because they make money out of it. Thus, all that we achieved now is to replace trust in an individual company maintaining a database with a network of databases (distrinuted ledgers) to make and move money around. Our X-Coins are created by miners and they can sell it to another through the same network of ledgers or use it to purchase stuff through the same network of ledgers or just keep it with them using the same network of ledgers.
    <br><br>

    In banking, we keep money with a bank, transfer it or spend it for stuff that we need. The same is now achieved by our X-Coins in a different way. Therefore, we can now call our X-Coin a currency of short.
    <br><br>
    <br>

    <h3 class="side-heading-blue">Is Crpto + Currency = Cryptocurrency?</h3>
    <br>

    The name Cryptocurrency seem to mean that it is a currency and something to do with cryptography. But is it really so? Let's explore.
    <br><br>

    We created a currency called "X=Coin" based on a distributed ledger system because we did not want to trust any single institution, instead we wanted to put our trust in different unknown people maintaining a distributed ledger system. We also said that this distributed ledger or database would be based on cryptographic proof. Our X-Coin is capable of being held and traded. Think of this like a number that is written against your name in a distributed ledger system and this number can be transferred to someone else. But if you wish to hold it then it would continue to appear against your name in the ledger. This is very similar to money balance that you have in your bank account. It is also a number in a database, which represents the amount that you currently have. You can transfer that number to someone else or purchase goods and services. So, our X-Coin is no different. We are essentailly dealing with numbers in a database that can be held or transferred for commerce purposes. When we think in this fashion, our X-Coin is a currency just like any other currency out there. However, there are some differences.
