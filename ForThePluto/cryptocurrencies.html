    <h2 class="main-heading-blue">Cryptocurrencies - A Question of Trust</h2>
    <div class="fordate">By Putcha Vijay Kumar, Date: 2nd November 2022</div>

    <br><br>

    I am not sure what to write on Cryptocurrencies. There is so much literature on this topic that it feels a bit useless contributing more to the already abundant knowledge. Nonetheless, many have requested information on this topic and hence I am sharing my thoughts about it through this article. It is a long article but I hope it would be useful. 
    <br><br>

    <h3 class="side-heading-blue">Game of Database Entries</h3>
    <br>
    If I say I have $100 in a bank (say Bank of America), in one way, I am saying that Bank of America has got a database in which against my name there is a credit of $100. If I want to transfer $50 to my friend Kiran, who has also got an account in Bank of America, this means, Bank of America is reducing $50 against my name in its database and increasing $50 against Kiran's name in its database. Similarly, if I am sending $20 to my friend Arvind, who holds a bank account with Citibank, ignoring the transaction methodology, we can say that $20 is reduced from my name in the database of Bank of America and the same is increased against Arvind's name in the database maintained by Citibank. If there is nothing against my name in the database of Bank of America, it means I do not have any money. I might have a few in hard currency notes and cash, but we will discuss this later.
    <br><br>
    Let's look at stocks. If I hold 100 shares of Intel, it means that there is a Central Security Depository (CSD) that is maintaining a database in which against my name there are 100 shares of Intel. If I transfer 50 shares to my friend, the CSD will change the records in its database by reducing against my name and increasing against my friend's name in its database. If my name does not appear in its record, it means that I do not own any shares.
    <br><br>
    Now, let's look at property. If I have a physical house, it also means that there is a registry maintained by the government in which my name appears as title holder of the house. If my name does not appear in this registry, then I may not have title to the property. I may be physically living in the house but if the information is missing in the database maintained by the government then it means that I have no legal rights on the property.
    <br><br>
    Let's look at messages. If I want to send an email, or post twitter message, or Facebook post, it means that there is a company which is maintaining a database in which my name appears and against my name some records (email and posts) appear.
    <br><br>
    We are living in a world where most of the information is stored digitally in databases and we trust the <mark>database keepers</mark>. In the above examples, we trust the bank to maintain the database well so that we know we have money, the central security depository to maintain a database so that we know we have stocks, companies such as Google, Twitter and Facebook to maintain their databases so that we can send messages, posts and pictures, and a government registry to maintain the property register properly so that we can have ownership of our property.
    <br><br>
    <span class="flexbox-1">
        Just imagine if we merge all these different databases into one large database, which is run by just one or few companies. Whoever runs that database would be the most powerful person on Earth. They will control our lives and the way the world works.
    </span>
    <br><br>
    So, essentially we are trusting someone for something all the time. Through a system of laws, the trust is enforced, and the world works the way we know it now.
    <br><br>
    Sometimes this trust may not work as we expect and companies may take advantage of its position and trust. A recent example of this is of Google's Play Store services. Google's mobile operating software "Android" has the highest market share in India, just like it does in other countries. If a developer develops an app and wishes to make it available to mobile users using Android phones, then it must publish it in Google's Play Store and accept Google's terms and conditions. Most app developers would like to sell in-app digital goods as it is a source of income for them, which monetizes their creation and innovations. However, for in-app digital goods to be distributed to users, developers must first configure their apps so that all purchases of the digital goods go through Google's payment system, which processes the transaction. Google's Play Store policies require the app developers to exclusively and mandatorily use Google Play's Billing System (GPBS). not only for receiving payments for apps but also for in-app purchases. Further, app developers cannot, within an app, provide users with direct links to the webpage containing an alternative payment method or use language that encourages a user to purchase the digital item outside of the app (anti-steering provisions). If the app developer do not comply with the GBPS, they are not allowed to list their apps in the play store. In short, Google was taking advantage of the app database that it maintains to make money for itself. The Competitive Commission of India (CCI) found these conditions anti-competitive and levied a fine of Rs. 936.44 crores and asked Google to change its policies.
    <br><br>
    So, the system of trust does not work automatically, it needs to be reinforced through a system of laws and enforcement mechanisms.
    <br><br>
    Anyway, whatever be the mechanism, the system works, and we are living in the system.
    <br><br>
    But the question is: <b>Why do we always need to trust someone?</b>. Can't we have a system where we do not have to trust anyone but the system itself. That is exactly the question asked by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008 when he published a famous white paper titled "A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System", which ended up inventing Bitcoin, the most popular cryptocurrency. We do not know whether Satoshi Nakamoto is a real person, but we will use that name as it is the name of the author in that white paper.
    <br><br>
    His argument is that we can have a peer-to-peer electronic database which is based on cryptographic proof instead of trust. One way to put it is: let's say I want to buy a cup of coffee for $10, for this I need to transfer $10 to the coffee vendor. The actual transfer is made by my bank which makes changes in its database. This means I and the coffee vendor are relying on a bank for this transaction to happen. This trust that we have on bank to complete the transaction is not free of cost, the bank might charge a few cents or dollars for enabling this transaction or making changes to its database. <b>This is the cost of trust.</b>
