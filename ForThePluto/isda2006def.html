<h3 align="center">INTRODUCTION TO THE 2006 ISDA DEFINITIONS</h3>
The 2006 ISDA Definitions (the “2006 Definitions”) are intended for use in confirmations of individual transactions (“Confirmations”) governed by agreements such as the 1992 ISDA Master Agreements and the 2002 ISDA Master Agreement (the “ISDA Master Agreements”) published by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. (“ISDA”). Copies of the ISDA Master Agreements are available from the executive offices of ISDA and on the ISDA website, www.isda.org. A sample form of document consisting a Confirmation is attached as Exhibit I. Exhibits II-a to II-H set out sample forms of specific provisions for inclusion in a Confirmation to document particular types of transactions.
<br/><br/>
The 2006 Definitions are an update to the 2000 ISDA Definitions (the “2000 Definitions”), which many parties to privately negotiated derivative transactions have incorporated into existing Confirmations or other documents. The 2006 Definitions can be incorporated into future Confirmations or other documents. Existing Confirmations or other documents that incorporate the 2000 Definitions will not, without further action by the parties, be affected by the use of the 2006 Definitions for subsequent transactions.
<br/><br/>
The purpose of the 2006 Definitions is to provide the basic framework for the documentation of privately negotiated interest rate and currency derivative transactions. Although the 2006 Definitions were drafted with this purpose in mind, ISDA recognizes that parties documenting other types of privately negotiated derivative transactions might find it helpful to incorporate the 2006 Definitions into Confirmations for those transactions. For example, when documenting an equity swap transaction using the 2002 ISDA Equity Derivatives Definitions or a commodity swap using the 2005 ISDA Commodity Derivatives Definitions, parties may wish to incorporate the 2006 Definitions into the relevant Confirmation in order to document more easily floating or fixed payment arising under those transactions.
<br/><br/>
As in the case of other product-specific sets of definitions published by ISDA, parties using the 2006 Definitions to document a transaction may adapt or supplement the standard provisions set out in the 2006 Definitions in accordance with the specific economic terms agreed between them.
<br/><br/>
The 2006 Definitions may be updated in the future to include additional definitions and provisions, and it is anticipated that currency and floating rate option definitions (and related definitions and provisions) will be added or changed from time to time as transactions involving rates and currencies not included in the 2006 Definitions become more prevalent or as necessary to reflect market practices. ISDA anticipates that it will publish amendments and supplements to the 2006 Definitions from time to time to (including on its website, www.isda.org). At any time a copy of the then-current version of the 2006 Definitions can be obtained from the executive offices of ISDA and also from the ISDA website.
<br/><br/>
Unless otherwise agreed, where parties incorporate the 2006 Definitions into a Confirmation, they will incorporate the 2006 Definitions as amended and supplemented through the date on which they enter into the relevant transactions. Amendments and supplements to the 2006 Definitions will be deemed to have been made when published by ISDA. If parties want to exclude one or more amendments or supplements made to the 2006 Definitions, they should, in the relevant Confirmation, specify the amendment(s) or supplement(s) that they want to exclude or specify an “as amended and supplemented through” date (e.g., “as amended and supplemented through January 1, 2008”).
<br/><br/>
ISDA has provided the 2006 Definitions to assist the smooth and efficient functioning of privately negotiated derivatives activity by providing a common set of terms for parties to use in preparing Confirmations. The precise document of each individual transaction remains, however, the responsibility of the parties concerned. ISDA does not assume any responsibility for any use to which the 2006 Definitions may be put, including, without limitation, any use of the 2006 Definitions in connection with any privately negotiated derivative transaction. Each party to a transaction evidenced by a Confirmation or other document referring to or incorporating the 2006 Definitions must satisfy itself that the 2006 Definitions are appropriate for the transaction, have been properly used or adapted in that Confirmation or other document and that the Confirmation or other document has generally been properly drafted, in each case to reflect the commercial intentions of the parties.
<br/><br/>
ISDA has not undertaken to review all applicable laws and regulations of any jurisdiction in which the 2006 Definitions may be used or any jurisdiction the currency of which may be subject of any privately negotiated derivative transaction, and therefore parties are advised to consider the application of any relevant jurisdictions regulatory, tax, accounting, exchange or other requirements that may exist in connection with entering into and documenting such a transaction.
<br/><br/>

<h3 align="center">CHANGES IN THE DEFINITIONS FROM THE 2000 DEFINITIONS</h3>

The 2006 Definitions reflect a number of changes from the 2000 Definitions.
<br/><br/>
<b><u>Consolidated Structure:</u></b><br/>
Certain definitions and provisions of the 2000 Definitions (including the Rate Options and related provisions) that were anticipated to need periodic updating were published in the Annex to the 2000 Definitions. There is no Annex to the 2006 Definitions. All definitions and provisions of the 2006 Definitions, including the Rate Options and related provisions, are contained in a single document, the 2006 Definitions.
<br/><br/>
<b><u>Day Count Fractions</u></b><br/>
In the course of developing the 2006 Definitions, ISDA surveyed its membership on usage of the day count fraction provisions in the 2000 Definitions with the goal of making them easier to sue and to ensure that, as described, they are in accordance with market practice. In response to feedback received, the definitions of the actual/actual day count fraction contained in Section 4.16(b) has been modified to add “Actual/Actual (ISDA)” and “Act/Act (ISDA)” and to eliminate “Actual/365”, “Act/365” and “A/365” as designations for the day count fractions. Feedback suggested that the former terms are commonly used, whereas the latter terms are now rarely used in the market. The substance of the definitions for this day count fraction remains unchanged from the 2000 Definitions.
<br/><br/>
A definition for an actual/actual day count fraction based on Rule 251 of the statues, by-laws, rules and recommendations of the International Capital Market Association (“ICMA”) has also been included as a new Section 4.16(c). This is based on the provision that was included in the Introduction to the 2000 Definitions as a suggested way in which parties could provide for such a day count fraction to apply to a transaction, an approach which appears to have been commonly adopted in the market. The 30/360 (or “Bond Basis”) day count fraction in Section 4.16(f) is now expressed as a formula but has not been modified in substance. The formula is designed to yield the same results in practice as the previous version of this day count fraction included in the 2000 Definitions.
<br/><br/>
In addition, the 2006 Definitions contain two alternative versions of the 30E/360 day count fraction. The 30E/360 (or “Eurobond Basis”) day count fraction in Section 4.16(g) has been modified from the version of the day count fraction with that designation included in the 2000 Definitions to reflect the formulation of 30E/360 used by organisations such as ICMA and the Federation Bancaire Francaise as well as in the Microsoft Excel spreadsheet software and by financial software vendors. The day count fraction in Section 4.16(h) of these 2006 Definitions, designated “30E/360 (ISDA)”, is designed to yield the same result in practice as the version of the 30E/360 day count fraction included in the 2000 Definitions. Both versions of the 30E/360 day count fraction included in the 2006 Definitions are expressed as formulas.
<br/><br/>
<b><u>Mark-to-Market Currency Swap Provisions:</u></b><br/>
Article 10 of the 2006 Definitions provides definitions and provisions to enable parties to document mark-to-mark currency swap transactions (“Mark-to-market Currency Swaps”). These transactions involve two currencies, with the Currency Amount in respect of one party being subject to periodic adjustment during the term of the transaction by reference to the then-prevailing currency exchange rate for the relevant currencies (“the Variable Currency Amount), while the Currency Amount in respect of the other party remains constant (the “Constant Currency Amount”). In addition to any payments of Fixed Amounts and/or Floating Amounts, on each Payment Date an amount is payable by one party to the other on account of any such adjustment in the Variable Currency Amount (an “MTM Amount”). Exhibit II-H provides Additional Provisions for a Confirmation of a Swap Transaction that is a Mark-to-market Currency Swap.
<br/><br/>
<b><u>Swaption Straddles:</u></b><br/>
Supplement 14 to the 2000 Definitions provided market participants with definitions and provisions to enable them to document swaption straddle transactions under those Definitions. The 2006 Definitions include similar terms and Exhibit II-E now provides Additional Provisions for a Confirmation of a Swap Transaction that is a Swaption or Swaption Straddle.
<br/><br/>
<b><u>Settlement Matrix and MTM Matrix:</u></b><br/>
Users of the 2000 Definitions will probably already be familiar with the ISDA Settlement Matrix for Early Termination and Swaptions (the “Settlement Matrix”). Separately from the 2006 Definitions, ISDA will update the Settlement Matrix for use with the 2006 Definitions and publish a new matrix, the 2006 ISDA Definitions MTM Matrix for Mark-to-market Currency Swaps (the “MTM Matrix”).
<br/><br/>
As described in Article 19 of these 2006 Definitions, the Settlement Matrix is deemed to apply to (i) transactions that feature early termination provisions and (ii) swaptions, in each case where they involve a currency that is included in the Settlement Matrix. Similarly, as described in Article 10, the MTM Matrix is deemed to apply to Mark-to-market Currency Swaps that involve a currency pair that is included in the MTM Matrix. Neither matrix will apply to a transaction if the parties to that transaction specify accordingly in the related Confirmation. Where a matrix applies to a transaction, certain elections that the parties would otherwise have to make in the relevant Confirmation will be deemed to be made in accordance with the elections specified in the matrix, except to the extent that such elections are inconsistent with terms specified by the parties in the Confirmation.
<br/><br/>
Each matrix will be updated and/or expanded from time to time, with each new version published on ISDA’s website, www.isda.org. Where parties enter into a transaction to which a matrix applies, the version of the matrix that will be deemed to apply will be the most recently published version of the matrix as of the date on which they enter into that transaction. If parties wish to apply the ers of an earlier version of the matrix, they can specify the version of the matrix that they want to apply in their Confirmation.
<br/><br/>
<b><u>Rate Options</u></b><br/>
Many of the rate option definitions contained in Section 7.1 of the 2006 Definitions have been amended, and various additional definitions have been included. In definitions of individual rate options that reference screen-based rate sources, the 2006 Definitions refer to only one Information Vendor due to the need to provide for one authoritative source in the event of a dispute. However, in response to requests from market participants and where warranted by market usage, the 2006 Definitions include multiple rate option definitions for certain floating rates, with each one referencing a different Information Vendor (e.g. separate CAD-LIBOR-BBA rate options reference Reuters, Bloomberg and SwapMarker sources). ISDA wishes to make clear that users of the 2006 Definitions are free, as a matter of operational convenience, to obtain rate information from sources other than the one listed in a specific rate option (including from other Information Vendors), bearing in mind that in the event of a discrepancy between the source actually used and the source referred to in the rate option definition, the latter will prevail.
<br/><br/>
<br/>
<h3>Practice Notes</h3><br/>
<b><u>Information Vendors</u></b><br/>
Apart from certain arrangements with ICAP plc and Reuters in relation to collecting information for publication on certain Reuters ISDAFIX pages, and the fact that certain relevant organizations may be associate members of ISDA, ISDA has no relationship with, is not affiliated with and has not received compensation from any of the organisations (“Information Vendors”) that have created or publish or provide the information that serves as a basis for the rates referred to in the 2006 Definitions. ISDA does not assume any responsibility for the non-availability of miscalculation of, or any error or omission in, any of the rates referred to in the 2006 Definitions and does not assume any responsibility for any use of any rate, price or published index in connection with a Swap Transaction or in connection with any other transaction.
<br/><br/>
<br/><br/>

<h3 align="center">2006 ISDA DEFINITIONS</h3>
Any or all of the following definitions and provisions may be incorporated into a document (including in electronic form) by wording in the document indicating that, or the extent to which, the document is subject to the 2006 ISDA Definitions (the “2006 Definitions”), as published by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. (“ISDA”). Unless otherwise agreed, where parties incorporate the 2006 Definitions into a document (including in electronic form), they will incorporate the 2006 Definitions as amended and supplemented through the date on which they enter into the relevant transaction or agreement. If parties want to exclude one or more amendments or supplements made to the 2006 Definitions, they should, in the relevant Confirmation, specify the amendment(s) or supplement(s) they wish to exclude or specify an “as amended and supplemented through” date. All definitions and provisions so incorporated in a document will be applicable to that document unless otherwise provided in that document, and all terms defined in these 2006 Definitions and used in any definition or provision that is incorporated by reference in a document will have the respective meanings set forth in these 2006 Definitions unless otherwise provided in that document. Any term used in a document will, when combined with the name of a party, have meaning in respect of the named party only.
