<br>

A Global Depository Receipt (GDR) is a negotiable instrument issued by a depository bank in international markets - typically in Europe and generally made available to institutional investors. It evidences ownership of shares in a foreign company. GDRs are like ADRs, except that while an ADR is issued in U.S. market, the GDR is issued in any market outside the home country of the issuer. 
<br><br>
Each GDR represents a specific number of underlying ordinary shares in the international company, on deposit with a custodian in the applicable home market. GDRs are quoted in the currency of the market in which it is issued. For example, if an Indian company issues GDRs in both UK and Japan and the UK GDRs will be quoted in GBP and the Japanese GDRs will be quoted in JPY. Generally, the GDRs are listed in markets of London, Luxembourg, Singapore, Frankfurt and Dubai.
